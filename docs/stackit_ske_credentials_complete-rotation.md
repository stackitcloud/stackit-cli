## stackit ske credentials complete-rotation

Completes the rotation of the credentials associated to a SKE cluster

### Synopsis

Completes the rotation of the credentials associated to a STACKIT Kubernetes Engine (SKE) cluster.

This is step 2 of a 2-step process to rotate all SKE cluster credentials. Tasks accomplished in this phase include:
  - The old certification authority will be dropped from the package.
  - The old signing key for the service account will be dropped from the bundle.
To ensure continued access to the Kubernetes cluster, please update your kubeconfig with the new credentials:
  $ stackit ske kubeconfig create my-cluster

If you haven't, please start the process by running:
  $ stackit ske credentials start-rotation my-cluster
