## Developer Guide

Prerequisites:

- [`Go`](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.22+
- [`yamllint`](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)

### Useful Make commands

These commands can be executed from the project root:

- `make project-tools`: install the required dependencies
- `make build`: compile the CLI and save the binary under _./bin/stackit_
- `make lint`: lint the code
- `make generate-docs`: generate Markdown documentation for every command
- `make test`: run unit tests

### Repository structure

The CLI commands are located under `internal/cmd`, where each folder includes the source code for each subcommand (including their own subcommands). Inside `pkg` you can find several useful packages that are shared by the commands and provide additional functionality such as `flags`, `globalflags`, `tables`, etc.

### Implementing a new command

Let's suppose you want to want to implement a new command `bar`, that would be the direct child of an existing command `stackit foo` (meaning it would be invoked as `stackit foo bar`):

1. You would start by creating a new folder `bar/` inside `internal/cmd/foo/`
2. Following with the creation of a file `bar.go` inside your new folder `internal/cmd/foo/bar/`
   1. The Go package should be similar to the command usage, in this case `package bar` would be an adequate name
   2. Please refer to the [Command file structure](./CONTRIBUTION.md/#command-file-structure) section for details on the strcutre of the file itself
3. To register the command `bar` as a child of the existing command `foo`, add `cmd.AddCommand(bar.NewCmd(p))` to the `addSubcommands` method of the constructor of the `foo` command
   1. In this case, `p` is the `printer` that is passed from the root command to all subcommands of the tree (refer to the [Outputs, prints and debug logs](./CONTRIBUTION.md/#outputs-prints-and-debug-logs) section for more details regarding the `printer`)

Please remeber to run `make generate-docs` after your changes to keep the commands' documentation updated.

#### Command file structure

Below is a typical structure of a CLI command:

```go
package bar

import (
	(...)
)

// Define consts for command flags
const (
   someArg = "MY_ARG"
   someFlag = "my-flag"
)

// Struct to model user input (arguments and/or flags)
type inputModel struct {
	*globalflags.GlobalFlagModel
	MyArg string
	MyFlag *string
}

// "bar" command constructor
func NewCmd() *cobra.Command {
	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "bar",
		Short: "Short description of the command (is shown in the help of parent command)",
		Long:  "Long description of the command. Can contain some more information about the command usage. It is shown in the help of the current command.",
		Args:  args.SingleArg(someArg, utils.ValidateUUID), // Validate argument, with an optional validation function
		Example: examples.Build(
			examples.NewExample(
				`Do something with command "bar"`,
				"$ stackit foo bar arg-value --my-flag flag-value"),
			...
		),
		RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
			ctx := context.Background()
			model, err := parseInput(cmd, args)
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}

			// Configure API client
			apiClient, err := client.ConfigureClient(cmd)
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}

			// Call API
			req := buildRequest(ctx, model, apiClient)
			resp, err := req.Execute()
			if err != nil {
				return fmt.Errorf("(...): %w", err)
			}

         projectLabel, err := projectname.GetProjectName(ctx, cmd)
				if err != nil {
					projectLabel = model.ProjectId
				}

         // Check API response "resp" and output accordingly
         if resp.Item == nil {
            p.Info("(...)", projectLabel)
				return nil
         }
			return outputResult(cmd, model.OutputFormat, instances)
		},
	}

	configureFlags(cmd)
	return cmd
}

// Configure command flags (type, default value, and description)
func configureFlags(cmd *cobra.Command) {
	cmd.Flags().StringP(myFlag, "defaultValue", "My flag description")
}

// Parse user input (arguments and/or flags)
func parseInput(cmd *cobra.Command, inputArgs []string) (*inputModel, error) {
   myArg := inputArgs[0]

	globalFlags := globalflags.Parse(cmd)
	if globalFlags.ProjectId == "" {
		return nil, &errors.ProjectIdError{}
	}

	return &inputModel{
		GlobalFlagModel: globalFlags,
      MyArg            myArg,
		MyFlag:          flags.FlagToStringPointer(cmd, myFlag),
	}, nil
}

// Build request to the API
func buildRequest(ctx context.Context, model *inputModel, apiClient *foo.APIClient) foo.ApiListInstancesRequest {
	req := apiClient.GetBar(ctx, model.ProjectId, model.MyArg, someParam)
	return req
}

// Output result based on the configured output format
func outputResult(cmd *cobra.Command, outputFormat string, resources []foo.Resource) error {
	switch outputFormat {
	case globalflags.JSONOutputFormat:
		details, err := json.MarshalIndent(resources, "", "  ")
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("marshal resource list: %w", err)
		}
		p.Outputln(string(details))
		return nil
	default:
		table := tables.NewTable()
		table.SetHeader("ID", "NAME", "STATE")
		for i := range resources {
			resource := resources[i]
			table.AddRow(*resource.ResourceId, *resource.Name, *resource.State)
		}
		err := table.Display(cmd)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("render table: %w", err)
		}
		return nil
	}
}
```

Please remeber to always add unit tests for `parseInput`, `buildRequest` (in `bar_test.go`), and any other util functions used.

If the new command `bar` is the first command in the CLI using a STACKIT service `foo`, please refer to [Onboarding a new STACKIT service](./CONTRIBUTION.md/#onboarding-a-new-stackit-service).

#### Outputs, prints and debug logs

The CLI has 4 different verbosity levels:

- `error`: For only displaying errors
- `warning`: For displaying user facing warnings _(and all of the above)_
- `info` (default): For displaying user facing info, such as operation success messages and spinners _(and all of the above)_
- `debug`: For displaying structured logs with different levels, including errors _(and all of the above)_

For prints that are specific to a certain log level, you can use the methods defined in the `print` package: `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, and `Debug`.

For command outputs that should always be displayed, no matter the defined verbosity, you should use the `print` methods `Outputf` and `Outputln`. These should only be used for the actual output of the commands, which can usually be described by "I ran the command to see _this_".

### Onboarding a new STACKIT service

If you want to add a command that uses a STACKIT service `foo` that was not yet used by the CLI, you will first need to implement a few extra steps to configure the new service:

1.  Add a `FooCustomEndpointKey` key in `internal/pkg/config/config.go` (and add it to `ConfigKeys` and set the to default to `""` using `viper.SetDefault`)
2.  Update the `stackit config unset` and `stackit config unset` commands by adding flags to set and unset a custom endpoint for the `foo` service API, respectively, and update their unit tests
3.  Setup the SDK client configuration, using the authentication method configured in the CLI

    1.  This is done in `internal/pkg/services/foo/client/client.go`
    2.  Below is an example of a typical `client.go` file structure:

        ```go
        package client

        import (
           (...)
           "github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-sdk-go/services/foo"
        )

        func ConfigureClient(cmd *cobra.Command) (*foo.APIClient, error) {
           var err error
           var apiClient foo.APIClient
           var cfgOptions []sdkConfig.ConfigurationOption

           authCfgOption, err := auth.AuthenticationConfig(cmd, auth.AuthorizeUser)
           if err != nil {
              return nil, &errors.AuthError{}
           }
           cfgOptions = append(cfgOptions, authCfgOption, sdkConfig.WithRegion("eu01")) // Configuring region is needed if "foo" is a regional API

           customEndpoint := viper.GetString(config.fooCustomEndpointKey)

           if customEndpoint != "" {
              cfgOptions = append(cfgOptions, sdkConfig.WithEndpoint(customEndpoint))
           }

           apiClient, err = foo.NewAPIClient(cfgOptions...)
           if err != nil {
              return nil, &errors.AuthError{}
           }

           return apiClient, nil
        }
        ```

### Local development

To test your changes, you can either:

1. Build the application locally by running:

   ```bash
   $ go build -o ./bin/stackit
   ```

   To use the application from the root of the repository, you can run:

   ```bash
   $ ./bin/stackit [group] [subgroup] [command] [flags]
   ```

2. Skip building and run the Go application directly using:

   ```bash
   $ go run . [group] [subgroup] [command] [flags]
   ```
